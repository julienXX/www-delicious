= Changelog


== julienXX

* FIXED: tags are now written in del.icio.us

== master

* FIXED: A trivial bug causes the test `test_request_waits_necessary_time_between_requests` to fail in case the subsequent request is sent exactly 1 second after the prior one.

* FIXED: Object#blank? is always redefined regardless already defined before.


== Release 0.3.0

* FIXED: Compatibility fixes for Ruby 1.9. WWW::Delicious is now 100% compatible with 1.9. You should remember to define the proper content encoding with magic comments when working with UTF-8/MultiByte XML or Ruby files, see http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/wiki/ruby-19/ScriptEncoding (closes #142).

* FIXED: Forced Rakefile to require Echoe >= 3.1 to prevent outdated .gemspec files (closes #143).

* CHANGED: Don't use File.dirname(__FILE__) in require statement to prevent recursive inclusions.


== Release 0.2.0

* ADDED: :base_uri initialization option allows to create a new instance specifying a custom base_uri for all API calls. This is useful, for example, if you want to use ma.gno.lia Mirror'd APIs (http://wiki.ma.gnolia.com/Mirror%27d_API) instead the del.icio.us one (thanks to JÃ¶rg Battermann).
